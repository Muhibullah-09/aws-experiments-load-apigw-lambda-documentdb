# aws-experiments-load-apigateway-lambda-documentdb

Load simulation of an API built with Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, Amazon DocumentDB and AWS CDK.

## Description

This experiment simulates API calls to an API built with AWS CDK and the following services:

- [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)
- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
- [Amazon DocumentDB](https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/)

As the lambda require to be set into a VPC to connect the DocumentDB database, we will face more important cold start. Therefore, this experiment also leverage the serverless plugin [warmup](https://github.com/FidelLimited/serverless-plugin-warmup). This is to wait for GA of the new [AWS Lambda architecture that will share ENIs](https://youtu.be/QdzV04T_kec?t=2393) and become much faster.

## What we build

TODO: Insert diagram

## Pre requisites

For this experiment you will need the following:

- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
- An AWS account. If you don‚Äôt have an AWS account, you can create a free account [here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup/iam).
- Node.js (>= 8.10). To install Node.js visit the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) website. You can also a node version manager: [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [AWS CDK toolkit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html)

If this is the first time you deploy a CDK application in an environment you need to bootstrap it. Please take a look at the bootstrap section of the [CDK workshop](https://cdkworkshop.com/20-typescript/20-create-project/500-deploy.html).

- [artillery](https://artillery.io/): `$> npm install -g artillery`

## Deployment

### Create Secret Manager secrets for the database

Execute the following command in your Terminal

```bash
$> aws secretsmanager create-secret --name AwsExperimentsLoadApigwLambdaDocumentdb/docdbsecrets --secret-string '{"masterUserPassword": "XXX-XXX-XXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX","masterUsername": "masteruser"}'
```

Retrieve the arn for the displayed result, you will use it when you deploy the CDK application.

### Install dependencies

### Deploy the application

```bash
$> cdk deploy --context docdbsecret_arn=arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:XXXXXXXXXXXX:secret:AwsExperimentsLoadApigwLambdaDocumentdb/docdbsecrets-XXXXXX -c docdbsecret_username=masteruser -c docdbsecret_password=XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX
```

Or you can specify the same context variable and value in the `cdk.json` file, use the following code:

```json
{
  "app": "npx ts-node bin/aws-experiments-load-apigw-lambda-documentdb.ts",
  "context": {
    "docdbsecret_arn": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:XXXXXXXXXXXX:secret:AwsExperimentsLoadApigwLambdaDocumentdb/docdbsecrets-XXXXXX",
    "docdbsecret_username": "masteruser",
    "docdbsecret_password": "XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX"
  }
}
```

## Load the application

```bash
$> artillery run artillery.yml
```

## Results

## Developing

Since this CDK project is typescript based, sources need to be compiled to JavaScript every time you make a modification to source files. This project is configured with a nice little npm script called `watch` that automatically compile `.js` file every time you make a change

### Start watching for changes

In the home directory, open a new terminal and enter:

```bash
$> npm run watch
```

### Useful commands

- `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
- `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
- `cdk destroy`     destroy the CDK application in your default AWS account/region

## Clean up

Destroy the CDK application:

```bash
$> cdk destroy
```
